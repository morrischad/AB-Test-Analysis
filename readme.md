# Prosper Loan Data Exploration, Visualization, and Communication of Findings
Data Source: There are two CSV files within this repository with the relevant data for this project. One is for the website conversion data, ab_data.csv, and the other is for the related geographic related data, countries.csv.

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
For this project, I worked to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. My goal was to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision. This was a project as part of my Udacity data analyst nanodegree program.
